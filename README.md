# mnist_dataset_deep_learning

Tensorflow implementation of handwritten digit classificaiton with very popular mnist dataset.
Tensorflow model follows two CNN layers with relu and tanh as activation functions respectively. It is a naive implementation for first steps with tensorflow. 
To replicate simply clone the project, install tensorflow, matplotlib, numpy and you are ready to go.
